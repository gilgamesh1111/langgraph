Subject: Unable to Attend Meeting

Dear Tom,

I hope this message finds you well. Unfortunately, I will not be able to make it to the meeting at the scheduled time. However, I am available at 12 a.m. New York time if a rescheduling is possible. Please let me know if there is any other way I can contribute or stay updated on the discussions.

Thank you for understanding.

Best regards,
Gilgamesh
